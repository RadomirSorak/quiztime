# Radomir Sorak "QUIZ TIME"

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I decided to make a fast Quiz app for my school project where you can register and log in and play a 10 question quiz testing your knowledge on your preffered category and difficulty.

This App is made with React framework including HTML, CSS & JavaScript only with all dependencies needed to run the app.
## How To Install

Open up the terminal bellow, and type in :

### `npm install`

This command will install all data for you so you can run the app without errors.

You might need to install following commands if "npm stall" doesn't install all modules needed to run the app:

### `npm install react`
### `npm install axios`
### `npm install react-router-dom`

## How to start

After installment is completed you can type in the terminal next command to open up the project in your browser:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
